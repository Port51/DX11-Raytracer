# Multi-Threaded Ray Tracer and Ray Marcher

This is a personal project based on the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series (https://raytracing.github.io/).

## Features:
* Multi-threaded approach using tiles
* Volumetric ice using ray marching
* Infinite 3D perlin noise generator using modified PCG-3D algorithm
* Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) using AABBs
* Depth of field
* Motion blur
* Lambert, metal, and dielectric material types
* Output displayed using DirectX 11 window
* Results accumulate over time so you can watch the quality increase with more iterations
